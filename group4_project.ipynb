    "\n",
    "In the modern digital era, social media platforms like Twitter (now X) have become powerful channels for consumers to express opinions, experiences, and emotions about brands, products, and services. These views can significantly influence purchasing decisions, brand reputation, and marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manually tracking and interpreting this vast, unstructured feedback is impractical for companies. As a result, organizations increasingly turn to **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning models** to automatically analyze and interpret tweet sentiments.\n",
